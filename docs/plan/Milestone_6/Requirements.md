### Possible adjustment of Project Scope

From the original Requirements and idea of the web page, we have changed a huge amount of detail. From the previous one, we don't plan on anything being taken out, and we plan to finish everything listed above in the current requirements, and possibly have time to continue adding a handful of non-important details to the website before the semester finishes.
