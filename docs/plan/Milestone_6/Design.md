# Design 

## Main Synopsis 

The design of the website has come a long way and we are now getting to the good stuff of actual design management. We now, after fixing the handful of issues that will be open up to us due to our presentation, will then be allowed some time to soley focus on the look of the website. For Milestone 6, I managed to update the CSS file to have global variables. The process was started in Milestone 4 but didn't get finished until now. We can now switch the color scheme as we'd like and I think the harder part is to actually get the team to decide on a specific look. Another beautiful thing we may try will come with having an image be covered by a faded color down. So a stary night background fading into black would also be a nice look in a webpage, but that will be for further discussion by the team.

## Future work

There is no longer any future work to be done in the design of the webpage. The design of the sizing of shoes is still needed, but the architecture of the code falls on all of us now. It will consist of javascript to get the size passed to the product and hopefully we can find a simple way of doing it.
