# Test Role - Continuous Integration


### Build and Test with every push

Through the process of deducing our issues with the code, everyone contributed to the build of the guest user and therefore we were all merging to a repo on Git and committing and pulling and pushing. Through this process I had a part in pulling code that was constantly being updated and checking the validity of the work. Making sure no errors were being thrown and when errors did show, I posted about them in the issues log.
